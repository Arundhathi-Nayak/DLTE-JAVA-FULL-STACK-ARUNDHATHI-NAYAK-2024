===================
  INHERITANCE
===================

derivedClass extends from baseClass
derivedInterface extends baseInterface

derivedClass implements baseInterface

One parent class can be inherited not more Than That(Ambuguity is there);
In C++ there is a virtual base class so multiple Iheritance is possiblee;
Javas all methods are virtual methods.

One base class to drive multiple base class (Hierarchical Inheritance).

1.Single
2.Multilevel
3.Hierarchy
4.hybrid

Between (class,Interface)

multiple interface can be implemented by single class(interface for only abstract methods)

overdding

between classes only on inheritance

RUn time polymorphism

signature without definition- abstract
